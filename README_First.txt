uniCenta oPOS v3.56
Date: 2 December 2013 @ 00:00


************  Important Notice ******************
This version is a bug fix for 3.55 version.
Please read the RN_3.56.txt Release Notes in the installation folder.

Upgrading Version from v3.55

Installing over earlier versions than v3.55 will upgrade but you will receive
errors due to missing table fields.
You will need to detect and fix the missing fields manually.

If you are installing on a Mac.
uniCenta oPOS will run on a MAC and has been tested with OSX 10.8.5 and
Java 7.45 JRE
Please visit Apple and Java sites to ensure you follow their guidance for
the correct OS and Java versions and that they are installed correctly before 
running the uniCenta oPOS install.

All uniCenta oPOS files are in one folder and if you're comfortable with 
copying files then simply copy them out of the installer package 
(Inspect Contents) and into a folder of your choosing.
You can then run the unicentaopos.jar directly.

If you are installing on Linux
I can only test up to a point with Linux - which may not surface some install
issues
